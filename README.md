# calibration-and-3D-projection-camera-calibration
This repository allows to calibrate a camera using Chess images. It finds the intrinsic camera parameters and write them in a JSON file.
Second part: reads a JSON file with intrinsic parameters, tilt angle, pan angle, distance and height. This information is used to perform a projective cube drawing in a 2D image from 3D coordinates of real space.
